# Crop-yield-prediction-webapp🚜🌾
This project focuses on predicting crop yield based on various environmental and agricultural factors using Machine Learning techniques. The goal is to help farmers, agricultural businesses, and policymakers make data-driven decisions to improve productivity and sustainability.

📌 Features
Crop yield prediction based on input parameters like:

Temperature

Rainfall

Soil type

Crop type

Other relevant features (customizable)

Data preprocessing and feature engineering

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data visualization

Machine Learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)

Model evaluation with accuracy metrics (R², MAE, RMSE, etc.)

Option to easily deploy as a web app (using Streamlit / Flask / Django – if implemented)

📊 Dataset
Source: Kaggle, [Government agricultural databases], or custom collected dataset.

⚙️ Tech Stack
Python

Scikit-learn

Pandas, NumPy

joblib,xgboost
